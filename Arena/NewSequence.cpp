 * Harold always boasted about his prowess with numbers. So one day Reese challenged him to a problem. He gave Harold two numbers X and Y and asked him to find out the Nth number of the series which began with X numbers of Yâ€™s and the following elements are equal to the sum of the last X numbers in the series. Help Harold find the Nth number of the series.

Input:
The first line contains a number T , number of test cases.
The next T lines each contain 3 integers X, Y and N separated by single space.

Output:
For each test case print the Nth number of the sequence.

Constraints:
1<=T<=10^6
0 < N <= 50
0 < X < 50
0 <= Y< 3
